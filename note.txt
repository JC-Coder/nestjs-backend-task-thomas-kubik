Build a REST API for a blog with the following requirements:
1. Implement the following endpoints:
a. POST /posts: Create a new post
b. GET /posts: Retrieve a list of all posts
c. GET /posts/{id}: Retrieve a specific post by its id
d. PUT /posts/{id}: Update a specific post by its id
e. DELETE /posts/{id}: Delete a specific post by its id


2. Each post should have the following properties:
a. id (autogenerated)
b. title
c. content
d. author
e. dateCreated (autogenerated)
f. dateModified (autogenerated)


3. The API should validate the request payload for creating and updating a post.
a. The title and content properties are required and should not be empty.
b. The title property should not exceed 100 characters.
c. The content property should not exceed 500 characters.


4. Store the posts in memory (no need for a database).

5. Implement error handling for invalid requests and non-existing resource.

6. Add Swagger documentation to the API using the @nestjs/swagger module.

7. Bonus: Write tests for all the endpoints using Jest.
